## MyToken Project

A straightforward implementation of an ERC20-like token contract in Solidity.




## Description
This project showcases the creation of a basic ERC20-like token on the Ethereum blockchain. The token contract includes functionalities for minting and burning tokens, allowing for dynamic supply management. The token has publicly accessible details like name, symbol, and total supply, and maintains a mapping of addresses to their respective balances.
## Getting Started
## Installation

To install and use the contract, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/VisionaryVenture/MyTokenProject.git
```
    
## Running the Program
To deploy and interact with the contract, follow these steps:

Open the project in your preferred Solidity development environment (e.g., Remix, Truffle).
Compile the MyToken.sol contract.
Deploy the contract to the desired Ethereum network.
Use the provided functions to mint and burn tokens.

Example Commands:

To mint tokens:
```solidity
MyToken.mint("0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890", 100);

```
To burn tokens:
```solidity
MyToken.burn("0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890", 50);


```
## Help
For common issues or problems, consider the following:

•Ensure you have sufficient gas for transactions.

•Verify that the address and amount parameters are correct when calling mint or burn functions.
